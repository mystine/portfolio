#Mystine

#Hello,

My name is Mystine. I am a French Canadian Graphic Designer based out of Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy working in the Graphic Design field because it challenges my creative side, but it also develops my intellectual side, because I am constantly learning and discovering new techniques to use. Iâ€™ve learnt over the years that your talents will be recognized through hard work and belief, and with that being said, I hope to one day create my own brand to share with the world. On a side note, I love cats and a wine fanatic. Cheers!
