        <p id="introduction" class="intro kilo">My name is Mystine. I am a French Canadian Graphic Designer based out of Ottawa, Ontario. I have been studying in Graphic Design for the past 3 years and I am really passionate about it. I enjoy working in Graphic Design field because it challenges my creative side, but it also develops my intellectual side, because I am constantly learning and discovering new techniques to use. I’ve learnt over the years that your talents will be recognized through hard work and belief, and with that being said, I hope to one day create my own brand to share with the world. On a side note, I love cats and a wine fanatic. Cheers!</p>
